Because they build a foundation in problem-solving, collaboration, and fast-learning, we find that about a quarter of graduates go to work in technologies we didn't teach them like Python, Java, Salesforce, Angular, TypeScript, etc.\n\nSeparate programs with a longer time frame allow students to get a deeper understanding of their chosen specialty in addition to the basic skills needed to work in a modern web development team. When Turing students graduate, they're ready to hit the ground running. Let us help you find the one that's right for you.",
