Despite our best efforts to keep everyone safe, the possibility of contracting COVID is always present. If you feel like you might have contracted COVID or have tested positive after the conference, here are some steps we'd like to you take:

If you have any [COVID symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/coronavirus-self-checker.html?s_cid=ccbot_004#cdc-chat-bot-open):

- Please get tested.

- Fill-out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrYkhHAxzQpsBCI0), whether the result is positive or negative. We will not capture any PII, it is simply for counting purposes.

If you test positive for COVID:

- Mark yourself as positive exposure on your phone, so that folks who've been in your vicinity for more than 15 mins get notified.
