* When: Friday, Sept 2 (9am - 5pm)
* Where: Sunriver Resort
* Instructor: [Joe Previte](https://www.typescriptcourse.com)

Learn the fundamentals of TypeScript by building a library from scratch, publishing it on npm and using it in a production app. 

We'll dive into the code head-first by using TDD to build a streak counter library. This will be jam-packed with hands-on coding that mimics real-world use of TypeScript. 

### Prerequisites

* Intermediate JS knowledge

### Agenda

9am-12:30pm: Interactive sessions with breaks in between

12:30-1:30pm: Lunch

1:30-5:00pm: Interactive sessions with breaks in between

Blocks range from 45-75mins and breaks are 15mins each. This workshop will be fully hands-on with some short lectures, group discussions and lots of coding. By the end, you'll have a library on npm.
