* Instructor: [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com)

Next.js is a practical and performant choice for building web applications with React and TypeScript. Take it a step further and include Turborepo for code reuse and excellent multi-player team capabilities with minimal technical overhead.

You will build out the shell for a content driven-application that includes authentication, a CMS, and Stripe integration for e-commerce. Along the way you’ll test the most important aspects and create packages that can be published to NPM and used across more applications in your mono-repo using the same patterns.

Finally, we will deploy the application to Vercel and explore CI/CD through Github Actions.

### Prerequisites

This is an intermediate to advanced workshop. We will assume working familiarity with React, TypeScript, git, and npm. Some experience with Next.js will be a big help. 

### Agenda

We will start with setup and introduction that will outline the day. From there we will incrementally build our application, discussing decisions, tradeoffs, and alternatives along the way. There will be plenty of hands-on time to work and explore the tools.

- 09:00a - doors open
- 12:30p - lunch
- 01:30p - afternoon session begins
- 04:00p - workshop ends
