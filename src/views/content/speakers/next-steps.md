Thanks for joining us to speak at CascadiaJS 2022! <i class="fas fa-heart"></i>

Please keep the news private for now and stayed tuned for your speaker announcement, we'll make sure to tag you on Twitter.

Below is a checklist of items to take care of before the conference. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need help with anything!

## Speaker Ticket

Make sure to register for your Speaker Ticket, the link should have been provided in an email.

## Travel

Check out our [Travel Guide](/travel) for ideas on how to get to Sunriver Resort for the conference. 

We are budgeting <span class="highlight warning">$1000 USD</span> to cover travel expenses for each speaker, so please try to stay within this limit. 

As you plan your travel, please try to be at Sunriver Resort no later than 5pm on August 30. Our current plan is to host our Speaker and Organizer Dinner on August 30, the evening before the first day of the conference.

Once you are booked, please email us your confirmation and a receipt so that we can reimburse you.

## Lodging

We will cover 3 nights of lodging at Sunriver Resort for the nights of Aug 30, Aug 31 and Sept 1. If you'd like to arrive earlier or depart later, that's totally OK, you'll just need to cover those extra nights.

## Corporate Sponsorship

If you think your employer might be willing to cover travel and/or lodging expenses in exchange for a Community Sponsorship of the conference, please let me know. If your employer might be willing to sponsor our conference in another capacity (funding Scholarships, setting-up an booth in our Expo Hall), please let me know. It takes a village to put on CascadiaJS, and everything helps!
