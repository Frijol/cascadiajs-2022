Below is a checklist of items to take care of before the conference. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need help with anything!

## Speaker Ticket

## Travel

Check out our [Travel Guide](/travel) for ideas on how to get to Sunriver Resort for the conference. We are budgeting to cover travel expenses to to <span class="highlight warning">$500 USD</span> for folks inside the USA and <span class="highlight warning">$1000 USD</span> for folks outside the USA. When you book, please try to stay within these limits, and contact us if you have an issue here.

## Lodging

We will cover 3 nights of lodging at Sunriver Resort for the nights of Aug 30, Aug 31 and Sept 1. If you'd like to arrive earlier or depart later, that's totally OK, you'll just need to cover those extra nights.

## Corporate Sponsorship

If you think your employer might be willing to cover travel and/or lodging expenses in exchange for a Community Sponsorship of the conference, please let me know. If your employer might be willing to sponsor our conference in another capacity (funding Scholarships, setting-up an booth in our Expo Hall), please let me know. It takes a village to put on CascadiaJS, and everything helps!
