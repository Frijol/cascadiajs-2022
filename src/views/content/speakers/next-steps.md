## Next Steps

Thanks for joining us to speak at CascadiaJS 2022! <i class="fas fa-heart"></i>

Please keep the news private for now and stayed tuned for your speaker announcement, we'll make sure to tag you on Twitter.

Below is a checklist of items to take care of before the conference. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need help with anything!

### Speaker Ticket

Make sure to register for your Speaker Ticket, the link should have been provided in an email.

### Travel

Check out our [Travel Guide](/travel) for ideas on how to get to Sunriver Resort for the conference. 

We are budgeting <span class="highlight warning">$1000 USD</span> to cover travel expenses for each speaker, so please try to stay within this limit. 

As you plan your travel, please try to be at Sunriver Resort no later than 5pm on August 30. Our current plan is to host our Speaker and Organizer Dinner on August 30, the evening before the first day of the conference.

Once you are booked, please email us your confirmation and a receipt so that we can reimburse you.

### Lodging

We will cover 3 nights of lodging at Sunriver Resort for the nights of Aug 30, Aug 31 and Sept 1. If you'd like to arrive earlier or depart later, that's totally OK, you'll just need to cover those extra nights.

### Corporate Sponsorship

If you think your employer might be willing to cover travel and/or lodging expenses in exchange for a Community Sponsorship of the conference, please let me know. If your employer might be willing to sponsor our conference in another capacity (funding Scholarships, setting-up an booth in our Expo Hall), please let me know. It takes a village to put on CascadiaJS, and everything helps!

## Preparing for the Conference

### Slide / Presentation Review

We trust that you are grown-ups and professionals, so we DO NOT NEED TO PRE-APPROVE YOUR SLIDES.

Make sure, however, to HAVE YOUR SLIDES BACKED-UP ONLINE before you leave for the conference. If your laptop has a misfortune in transit or at Cascadia, we can try to get a "loaner" on which to run your presentation.

## Giving Your Talk

### When your talk is scheduled

The official schedule is at: https://2022.cascadiaJs.com/schedule. Your green room check-in time is 20 minutes before that, but you're welcome to arrive earlier.

### Tech Specs

You present from your laptop, so use your favorite presentation program. FYI, we cannot guarantee it will run your presentation software, so have a contingency plan.

If you want to share your slides (recommended), put them on your GitHub or blog and share the link on your last or second to last slide.

Format: 16:9, 1920x1080 projection (FHD)

Video: ONLY GUARANTEED CONNECTOR IS HDMI. I will bring a USB-C to HDMI/LAN/USB-A&C mini-dock, but cannot guarantee it will work for your specific hardware even if you tell me the specs of your hardware in advance.

Presentation clicker: Also BYO, but I'll have a cheap one plugged into the mini-dock as back-up.

Internet: You can use the resort WiFi, but we'll have a hardwired connection at the podium. Note the mini-dock has a LAN port. Also note, internet connectivity at any venue can fail, so be prepared to give an "offline" version of your talk if you can.

### Tech Checks

If you'll want to do a tech check and make sure your equipment works well on the stage, please LMK now so we can make sure to schedule and invite you.

### Emcee

Aaron Turner is your emcee. He'll connect with you separately to get some info for your intro as well as any other info he needs to help your talk be successful.

### Accessibility and Accomodations

The podium and stage should be accessible for a variety of physical needs. But just to be sure, if you need specific physical accommodations for stage access or equipment access, please make sure I or Carter know.

### Audience Interaction

If you plan to interact with the audience--taking questions, asking questions, taking suggestions--remember that the audience members probably won't get picked up by a microphone. Practice repeating what you'd expect an audience member to say to you so both the in-person and online audiences are sure to know what was said.
