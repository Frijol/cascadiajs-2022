## About CascadiaJS

Since 2012, CascadiaJS has been the premier JavaScript and web conference in the Pacific Northwest. Every year we bring together hundreds of developers to help them:

<i class="fas fa-hand-holding-seedling"></i> Grow their network

<i class="fas fa-face-party"></i> Have fun and make friends

We are a kind and inclusive community with thoughtful [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) and our goal is to elevate local voices and advocate for an Open Web.

This year is our 10-year anniversary event and we are celebrating by returning to an in-person conference at the beautiful Sunriver Resort outside of Bend, OR. We have rented out the entire resort and can't wait to see everyone for 2+ days of learning, fun and connection.

### Bringing the Family

Sunriver Resort is the perfect place to bring your significant others and family. There are tons of fun things to do at the resort, including just hanging out at the pool and enjoying the late summer sun. In addition to all that Sunriver Resort has to offer, we will be offering:

* A Significant Other track of activities
* An affordable [Guest Pass](/conference/attend#bringing-guests) for adults & kids
* [Free Child Care](/conference/child-care), courtesy of our friends at [Formidable](https://formidable.com).

### Accessibility

All of the talks, remarks and banter that take place on the Main Track of the conference will be live-captioned by [White Coat Captioning](https://www.whitecoatcaptioning.com/). This captioning will be displayed on a screen at the in-person event and embedded directly on the website for livestream.

### Amazing Talks

The core of the conference is two days of talks from experts in the JS/web community covering everything from Node.js to the cutting edge of the Web Platform to creating a more inclusive tech community. Check-out our [full list of speakers](/speakers) and prepare to be inspired.

### Hands-on Workshops

In addition to our Talk Track, we will be curating a Workshop Track for folks who want to take a break from talks and get their hands dirty learning about web security, notification systems and other technical topics.

### All Inclusive

In addition to the talks and workshops, your ticket to the conference includes access to the Welcome Reception on August 30, three meals a day and evening events on August 31 and September 1 and a Farewell Brunch on September 2. Check out the [schedule](/schedule) to see what we've planned so far, and stay tuned because we keep adding to it!

### Outdoor Activities

Finally, for the first time ever, we are cutting the talks short on the first day and organizing a bunch of outdoor activities that attendees will be able to choose from. We can't reveal all the activities yet, but we hear a scavenger hunt might be one of them.

### We hope you can join us!

If you want to attend, but aren't sure you can justify the time and expense, we've written up a handy [Boss Letter Template](/conference/boss-letter) that you can use when emailing your manager. 

We hope this information is useful and weâ€™re excited to see you at CascadiaJS later this summer!
