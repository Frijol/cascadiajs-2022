## About Us

![CascadiaJS 2019 family photo](/images/past/cjs19-family.jpg)

Since 2012, CascadiaJS has been the premier JavaScript and web conference in the Pacific Northwest. Every year we bring together hundreds of developers to help them:

<i class="fas fa-rocket-launch"></i> Level up their skills

<i class="fas fa-hand-holding-seedling"></i> Grow their network

<i class="fas fa-face-party"></i> Have fun and make friends

We are a kind and inclusive community and our goal is to elevate local voices and advocate for an Open Web.

This year is our 10-year anniversary event and we are celebrating by returning to an in-person conference at the beautiful Sunriver Resort outside of Bend, OR. We have rented our the entire resort and can't wait to see everyone for 2+ days of learning, fun and connection.

Starting on August 30, attendees will enjoy a Welcome Reception, 2 days of talks from experts in the JS/web community, hands-on workshops, outdoor activities, evening social events and a Farewell Brunch on September 2. Check out the [schedule](/schedule) to see what we've planned so far, and stay tuned because we keep adding it!

If you want to attend, but aren't sure you can justify the time and expense, we've written up a handy [Boss Letter Template](/conference/boss-letter) that you can use when emailing your manager. 

We hope this information is useful and weâ€™re excited to see you at CascadiaJS later this summer!
