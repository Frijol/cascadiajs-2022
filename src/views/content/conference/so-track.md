## Connecting with fellow SO's

We have created an `#so-track` channel on our conference Discord server. Guest can <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/cascadiajs">join</a> and easily connect with other SO's to organize trips and activities on their schedule. 

There is so much to do at Sunriver Resort that we felt it was best to help folks self-organize as much as possible.
