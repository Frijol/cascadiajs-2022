Everything you need to know about checking-in, our Welcome Reception and how Pre-Registration will work!

## Check-in at Sunriver Resort

If you're staying at Sunriver Resort, check-in opens up at 3pm. Go ahead and drop-off your luggage and head over to the Welcome Reception.

## COVID checks

If you are an Attendee or a Guest over the age of 18, please make sure that you have proof of COVID vaccination and a negative COVID test. This is a requirement for entry to all of our events.

- Proof of vaccination can be your vaccination card (photo is OK) or government vaccination app
- Proof of negative test is a dated PCR or antigen test (photo is OK)

If you take a PCR test, the test itself (not the results) must take place within 48 hours of you registering for the conference.

If you take an antigen test (over the counter, take home test), please take that test within 24 hours of registering for the conference and write the date and time on the test.

## Welcome Reception and Pre-Registration (8/30)

We're welcoming everyone to Sunriver Resort with a fun Welcome Reception (powered by our friends at Fictiv) where you will be able to pre-register for the conference. This will enable you to "skip the line" the next morning, meaning more time for breakfast and hanging out with friends. 

Attendees and folks with Guest Passes MUST register in order to enter any of our events. Parents can pick up Guest Passes for their children. Here's what you can expect during the registration process:

- You will be asked to scan a QR code and fill-out a Google Form that asserts that you are vaccinated, have tested negative and are feeling well
- A staff member will verify you filled-out the form and verify vaccination and testing
- A staff member will retrieve your conference badge, swag bag and hoodie (if you registered prior to our June 5 deadline)
- Your swag bag will contain 1 drink ticket for the Welcome Reception, 2 drink tickets for the Job Fair and Social and 2 drink tickets for the Startup Fair and Social

If you registered after June 5, don't despair! If we have extra hoodies, we will give them away (first come first served) on Day Two, Sept 1.
