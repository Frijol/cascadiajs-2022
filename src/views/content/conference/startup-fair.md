Following dinner on Day Two, we are hosting our first ever Startup Fair and Social!

We invited early-stage startups building the next generation of developers to apply, and after several rounds of review we are excited to announce the six startups that will be exhibiting:

- [Socket](#socket)
- [Warrant](#warrant)
- [Codiga](#codiga)
- [Dedron](#dendron) 
- [Strac](#strac)
- [Tigris Data](#tigris-data) 

When you're not talking to the founders and checking out what they're building, feel free to grab a drink and catch up with friends old and new.
