This year, we are hosting our first ever Job Fair! This event will take place after dinner on the evening of August 31st and run from 7pm - 10pm. 

The purpose of this event is to connect folks who are looking for new jobs to companies looking to hire JS developers! 

When you're not talking to the founders and checking out what they're building, feel free to grab a drink and catch up with friends old and new.

### Mux

Mux is video for developers. Our mission is to democratize video by solving the hard problems developers face when building video: video encoding and streaming (Mux Video), video monitoring (Mux Data), and more. Video is a huge part of people’s lives, and we want to help make it better. We’re committed to building a healthy team that welcomes a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences. We want people who care about our mission, are ready to grow, believe in our values (from Be Human to Turn Customers Into Fans), and want to make the people around them better.
