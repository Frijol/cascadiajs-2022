This year, we are hosting our first ever Job Fair! This event will take place after dinner on the evening of August 31st and run from 7pm - 10pm. 

The purpose of this event is to connect folks who are looking for new jobs to companies looking to hire JS developers! 

When you're not talking to the founders and checking out what they're building, feel free to grab a drink and catch up with friends old and new.
