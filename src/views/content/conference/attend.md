## Lodging

### Sunriver Resort

![Sunriver Resort guest room](/images/sunriver/sunriver-guest-room.webp)

We highly recommend that attendees book lodging at Sunriver Resort on the nights of Aug 30, Aug 31 and Sept 1. This will put you as close as possible to all of the conference events and will ensure you don't miss any of the fun!

Conference attendees receive discounted room rates at Sunriver Resort and the 17.5% resort fee is waived. After you purchase your conference ticket, you'll receive an email with a special link to access these rates. You can book your rooms on-line or us the phone number on that website to complete booking.

*NOTE: you'll see the resort fee during online checkout, but it will be waived when you check-in at the resort.*

## Pets

Some folks have asked about whether CascadiaJS is a pet-friendly conference. We are currently working on figuring out what we can and can't offer regarding pets. Here's what we know for sure:

- Sunriver Resort offers [pet-friendly rooms](https://www.sunriverresort.com/hotel-and-vacation-rentals-overview/rooms-overview/pet-friendly-lodging-hotels-bend-central-oregon-activities).
- Pets CANNOT be left in Sunriver Resort guest rooms unattended.
- Pets will definitely be welcome at all of our events that take place outside.
- We are still looking into options for limited access to the inside or pet sitting on-site.
