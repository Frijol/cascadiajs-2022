*NOTE: you'll see the resort fee during online checkout, but it will be waived when you check-in at the resort.*

We highly recommend that attendees book lodging at Sunriver Resort on the nights of Aug 30, Aug 31 and Sept 1. This will put you as close as possible to all of the conference events and will ensure you don't miss any of the fun! If you would like to book extra nights outside of that range, click the link below and call the reservation line. They will be able to apply our group discount to the nights of August 29 and September 2 if there is availability.

The deadline to book lodging at our discounted rates is: <span class="highlight warning">Friday, July 15</span>

If you have **ANY ISSUES** booking lodging (finding the right room, finding preferred dates, pricing, etc) please email info@cascadiajs.com immediately so that we can help you out. The Sunriver Resort website and reservation line isn't always up-to-date or as helpful as they should be, so please contact us so that we can get you sorted.

There is a campground quite close to Sunriver Resort called [Big River Campground](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/deschutes/recreation/recarea/?recid=38308&actid=29) that currently has individual and group sites available. 

## Travel

## Child Care

We are offering professional, on-site child care for kids 12 and under. Please check out our [Child Care Guide](/conference/child-care) for more information on what we are providing and how you can reserve your spot.

## Bringing Guests

Guests, including family, friends and significant others, are welcome! If you would like your guest to join you for meals and activities, they will need a [Guest Pass](/tickets). A Guest Pass includes breakfast, lunch and dinner on August 31 and September 1, the Farewell Brunch and planned activies. For guests 18 years and older, it also includes access to the Welcome Reception and two evening events. Guest Passes are FREE for children 5 and under!

Alternatively, in place of purchasing a Guest Pass, your guests are free to dine at several different [on-site restaurants](https://www.sunriverresort.com/dining-eat-drink/food-and-drinks-overview). 


## Pets

Some folks have asked about whether CascadiaJS is a pet-friendly conference. We are currently working on figuring out what we can and can't offer regarding pets. Here's what we know for sure:

- Sunriver Resort offers [pet-friendly rooms](https://www.sunriverresort.com/hotel-and-vacation-rentals-overview/rooms-overview/pet-friendly-lodging-hotels-bend-central-oregon-activities).
- Pets CANNOT be left in Sunriver Resort guest rooms unattended.
- Pets will definitely be welcome at all of our events that take place outside.
- We are still looking into options for limited access to the inside or pet sitting on-site.
