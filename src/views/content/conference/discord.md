We have set-up a Discord Server for folks to chat and share gifs in!

Here are some channels you'll find:

- `#general` - a place to meet others and hangout
- `#talk-track` - chat about the talks as they happen
- `#ama-*` - ask speakers questions about their talks
- `#help-questions` - get help from organizers
