All in-person conference attendees will have the opportunity to RSVP for one of the following during our Activity Track on the afternoon of August 31. Make sure you [get your Conference Ticket](/tickets) and [RSVP](/home/dashboard) soon, because spaces are limited! A few notes:

- Activities run from roughly 4pm - 6pm, but timing may change per Activity.
- Activities are only open to Conference Attendees for now. We may open up registration to Guests later.
- See equipment requirements for each activity.

<h2>Kayaking by <img src="/images/sponsors/netlify.svg"/></h2>

Our friends at [Netlify](/sponsors/netlify) have reserved a block of single and double kayaks! Folks will head over to the Marina, check-out their gear and paddle down the Deschutes River. Here are details on how kayaking will work:

- You will have to depart the conference a little early and possibly miss a talk.
- We will arrange a shuttle to take you over to the Marina.
- The ride down the river is one way and can take **2:15 to 3 hours** to complete. 
- There is a clearly marked pickup point where you will be brought back to the Marina and then shuttled back over to the Lodge, hopefully in time for dinner!

So, this is by far the most intense activity and will require you to leave the conference a little early and arrive for dinner a little late, but promises to be worth it.

<h2>Scavenger Hunt by <img src="/images/sponsors/begin.svg"/></h2>

Our Activity Lead, Kelsey Breseman, loves to go Orienteering and has devised an amazing Scavenger Hunt that will require speed and wits. Our friends at [Begin](/sponsors/begin) will have some surprises in store as well, so don't miss out!

<h2>Sunriver Bike Ride by <img src="/images/sponsors/web3-storage.png"/></h2>

This will be a self-guided bike ride alongside the Deschutes River, among the pine trees, and past the horse fields, on over 40 miles of paved bike paths! The perfect place for cruising with your new friends at CascadiaJS. 

Bikes will be provided, but you can always bring your own.

## Yoga üèîüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®

Unwind from a day of talks and networking with some yoga on the lawn with Ginger Lee of [Sisters Yoga Outside](http://www.shakatownyoga.com/). You'll be supported by the cool grass and warmth of the sun, moving to the rhythm of your breath and sounds of the birds... and most likely a fire playlist.

Please plan on bringing your own yoga mat or beach towel.

## Bike to Benham Falls üö≤

This is a roughly 14-mile ride out to Benham Falls being led by Eric Artzt, a ride leader in the local Bend biking community. He promises this will be a fantastic Central Oregon experience!

The trails are either paved or gently rolling singletrack. The route is mostly flat with about 300 feet of accumulated climbing. We're still working on finalizing the route, but we expect getting out and back will take roughly 2 hours.

You will need to bring your own bike, or [reserve one](https://www.sunriverresort.com/activities/bike-rentals-family-paved-trails-perfect-for-learning-how-to-ride-a-bike) through the Bike Barn at Sunriver Resort.

## Nature Walk üå≤

This will be a self-guided walk through the trails around the Sunriver Resort Lodge.
