- Activities are only open to Conference Attendees for now. We may open up registration to Guests later.
- Equipment (kayaks, bikes, etc) will be provided where necessary.

<h2>Kayaking by <img src="/images/sponsors/netlify.svg"/></h2>

Our friends at [Netlify](/sponsors/netlify) have reserved a block of kayaks! Folks will head over to the Marina, check-out their gear, and spend 90 minutes or so paddling around the Deschutes River.

<h2>Scavenger Hunt by <img src="/images/sponsors/begin.svg"/></h2>

Our Activity Lead, Kelsey Breseman, loves to go Orienteering and has devised an amazing Scavenger Hunt that will require speed and wits. Our friends at [Begin](/sponsors/begin) will have some surprises in store as well, so don't miss out!

## Yoga 🏔🧘‍♀️✨

Unwind from a day of talks and networking with some yoga on the lawn with Ginger Lee of [Sisters Yoga Outside](http://www.shakatownyoga.com/). You'll be supported by the cool grass and warmth of the sun, moving to the rhythm of your breath and sounds of the birds... and most likely a fire playlist. 

## Biking 🚲

Bike alongside the Deschutes River, among the pine trees, and past the horse fields, on over 40 miles of paved bike paths! The perfect place for cruising with your new friends at CascadiaJS. Bikes will be provided, but you can always bring your own.

## Nature Walk 🌲

Join a naturalist from the Sunriver Nature Center & Observatory to explore the trails around the Sunriver Resort Lodge. We’ll search for wildlife such as eagles, otters, and other animals while learning all about Sunriver’s special forest habitat.
