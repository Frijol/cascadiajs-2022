All in-person conference attendees will have the opportunity to RSVP for one of the following during our Activity Track on the afternoon of August 31. Make sure you [get your Conference Ticket](/tickets) and RSVP soon, because spaces are limited!

<h2>Kayaking by <img src="/images/sponsors/netlify.svg"/></h2>

Our friends at [Netlify](/sponsors/netlify) have reserved a block of kayaks! Folks will head over to the Marina, check-out their gear, and spend 90 minutes or so paddling around the Deschutes River.

<h2>Scavenger by <img src="/images/sponsors/begin.svg"/></h2>

Our Activity Lead, Kelsey Breseman, loves to go Orienteering and has devised an amazing Scavenger Hunt that will require speed and wits. Our friends at [Begin](/sponsors/begin) will have some surprises in store as well, so don't miss out!

## Yoga

Unwind from a day of talks and networking and find your center with some yoga on the lawn. 

## Biking

Bike alongside the Deschutes River, among the pine trees, and past the horse fields, on over 40 miles of paved bike paths! The perfect place for cruising with your new friends at CascadiaJS.

## Nature Walk

Join a naturalist from the Sunriver Nature Center & Observatory to explore the trails around the Sunriver Resort Lodge. We’ll search for wildlife such as eagles, otters, and other animals while learning all about Sunriver’s special forest habitat.
