All in-person conference attendees will have the opportunity to RSVP for one of the following during our Activity Track on the afternoon of August 31. Make sure you [get your Conference Ticket](/tickets) and RSVP soon, because spaces are limited! A few notes:

- Activities run from roughly 4:30pm - 6:30pm, but timing may change per Activity.
- Activities are only open to Conference Attendees for now. We may open up registration to Guests later.
- Equipment (kayaks, bikes, etc) will be provided where necessary.

<h2>Kayaking by <img src="/images/sponsors/netlify.svg"/></h2>

Our friends at [Netlify](/sponsors/netlify) have reserved a block of kayaks! Folks will head over to the Marina, check-out their gear and paddle down the Deschutes River. Here are details on how kayaking will work:

- You will have to depart the conference a little early and possibly miss a talk.
- We will arrange a shuttle to take you over to the Marina.
- The ride down the river is one way and can take **2:15 to 3 hours** to complete. 
- There is a clearly marked pickup point where you will be brought back to the Marina and then shuttled back over to the Lodge, hopefully in time for dinner!

So, this is by far the most intense activity and will require you to leave the conference a little early and arrive for dinner a little late.

<h2>Scavenger Hunt by <img src="/images/sponsors/begin.svg"/></h2>

Our Activity Lead, Kelsey Breseman, loves to go Orienteering and has devised an amazing Scavenger Hunt that will require speed and wits. Our friends at [Begin](/sponsors/begin) will have some surprises in store as well, so don't miss out!

## Yoga 🏔🧘‍♀️✨

Unwind from a day of talks and networking with some yoga on the lawn with Ginger Lee of [Sisters Yoga Outside](http://www.shakatownyoga.com/). You'll be supported by the cool grass and warmth of the sun, moving to the rhythm of your breath and sounds of the birds... and most likely a fire playlist. 

## Biking 🚲

Bike alongside the Deschutes River, among the pine trees, and past the horse fields, on over 40 miles of paved bike paths! The perfect place for cruising with your new friends at CascadiaJS. Bikes will be provided, but you can always bring your own.

## Nature Walk 🌲

Join a naturalist from the Sunriver Nature Center & Observatory to explore the trails around the Sunriver Resort Lodge. We’ll search for wildlife such as eagles, otters, and other animals while learning all about Sunriver’s special forest habitat.
