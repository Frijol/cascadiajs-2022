We are offering FREE, professional, on-site child care for kids 12 and under through [Snappy Sitters](https://snappysitters.com). Child care will be available from 8:30am to 5pm and 7pm to 10pm on August 31 and September 1, and located onsite at Sunriver Resort in close proximity to the talks. All sitters will be fully vaccinated against Covid.

## On-site drop-off

We’ll have you complete a registration form for each child during the initial drop-off so that you can communicate any allergies, food preferences, special instructions or needs. 

## Food

Snacks will be provided. If you purchase a [Guest Pass](/conference/attend#bringing-guests) for your child, we will coordinate getting those meals to your kid for you. If you want to pack meals for your child, please label them with your child’s name. 

## Child-to-Nanny Ratios

We plan to offer a 1:3 ratio for children under 5, and a 1:6 ratio for children ages 6-12, with sitters assigned to each age group.

## Experience

All sitters have professional childcare experience, with background and reference checks, and are fully vaccinated against Covid. There will be CPR trained individuals on staff during the event.

## Activities

We’ll provide age-appropriate games, arts and crafts, toys, and activities, such as excursions to the playground.
