Experiences on the web have grown increasingly visual, from simply showing an image of a product in an online store to interactive media that gives you a digital hands-on look at your new NFT.

While sometimes this is just for fun, being able to provide a great visual experience in worlds like ecommerce helps to engage your potential customers, giving them an opportunity to get a closer look at your products and helping your store with conversion.

But it’s not as simple as dumping a bunch of photographs on a product page. Not paying attention to how your media is being delivered can impact your website or app’s Core Web Vitals turning those fun visuals into a bad user experience with slow-loading pages due to unoptimized images that can end up hurting conversion instead of helping.

How can we leverage media to engage our potential customers while still providing a great overall UX? We’ll talk about media’s role in building the visual web, methods we can use to showcase our products effectively, and how we can make sure we’re delivering media in a way that won’t negatively impact our store’s experience.
