When working on a new project, notifications can be a tough nut to crack. Sending email, push notifications to multiple geographies, global SMS, all present headaches that normally require low-level configuration and often a dedicated notifications micro-service.

With Courier you can send dynamically routed notifications to anywhere in the globe using a nicely abstracted template.

In this 2 hour workshop Nočnica and Shreya will get you from 0 to ‘Sending an SMS to Ghana’ in your Node.JS app.

### Prerequisites

Participants only need to be comfortable sending JSON API requests.

### Agenda

* Send your first notification
* Exploring the datalog
* Setup your node.js and start sending notifications
* (Optional) Automate your messages
