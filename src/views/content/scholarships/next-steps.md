Thank you for submitting a Scholarship application <i class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></i>

If you are able, feel free to purchase a special [50% off Scholarship Ticket](https://ti.to/event-loop/cascadiajs-2022/discount/SCHOLARSHIP). This pricing is available to anyone who qualifies for our Scholarship Program and has filled-out our Application. Please do not share this link with folks outside of the Application process.

If you are unable to purchase this ticket, please hang tight. Our goal is to start getting back to folks in early July.
