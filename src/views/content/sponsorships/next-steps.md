## Brand and Logo

Now that we have your logo and marketing copy, we will update our website and let folks know you're joining us this year. You should see 3 things shortly:

- Your logo on our [main landing page](/)
- A personalized internal landing page for Silver/Gold/Platinum ([example](/sponsors/200ok))
- A personalized social sharing image whenever this link is shared on Twitter/LinkedIn/Facebook/etc ([example](/sponsors/200ok?social))

If anything looks off or you'd like to change something, just let us know!

## Registering Sponsor Tickets

Each person who is attending CascadiaJS 2022 on behalf of your company **MUST** register for the conference **THEMSELVES** using the special link that we emailed to you. This is necessary even if they are simply staffing a booth or providing support. Please do not have an admin run through the registration process on behalf of other people.

We require this because everyone at the event must to agree to our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). It also enables us to capture information about swag preferences, dietary restrictions, etc. 

*We thank you in advance for your help here!*

## Booking Lodging at Sunriver Resort

We have secured discounted rooms for all attendees (and sponsors) of CascadiaJS 2022 at Sunriver Resort. These rooms are located directly next to the buildings where the conference events will be taking place. It is definitely where you will want to be staying during the event.

Please note, there are only ~250 total rooms at Sunriver Resort and we expect them to get booked out very quickly. So please make sure to book your lodging ASAP.

## Joining our Discord Community

Our Discord Community is an important place where we engage attendees leading up to and during the event. Please have folks join the community using the link below and have them send a DM to me (Carter Rabasa) so that I can assign them the "Partner" role.

## Social Media Guidance

Keep your eyes peeled for tweets from [@CascadiaJS](https://twitter.com/CascadiaJS). The official hashtags for this year's event are #CascadiaJS and #FamilyReunion.

We have also created a nascent [Twitter Community](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1496715959104466947), feel free to join and participate in the discussions there!

## COVID and Safety

We have published guidance on how we plan on [handling the safety of our attendees](/faq#covid) as it relates to COVID. Please review it and let us know if you have any questions.

## Expo Hall and Booths

![Expo Hall layout](/images/sunriver/homestead-expo-hall.png)

Expo Hall tables are 6 feet by 1 foot (6' x 1') and will be set-up in the entrance hall located directly outside of the Talk Track room. Unlike the diagram above, we will only set-up a maximum of 9 booths, so there will be space in between all of the booths to minimize crowding while inside. 

We will run power to each booth. Sponsors will be responsible for setting-up pop-up banners, tablecloths and staffing their booths.

Expo Halls hours will run from 8am - 3pm on August 31 and 8am - 5pm on September 1.
