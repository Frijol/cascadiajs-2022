## Brand and Logo

Now that we have your logo and marketing copy, we will update our website and let folks know you're joining us this year. You should see 3 things shortly:

- Your logo on our [main landing page](/)
- A personalized internal landing page for Silver/Gold/Platinum ([example](/sponsors/200ok))
- A personalized social sharing image whenever this link is shared on Twitter/LinkedIn/Facebook/etc ([example](/sponsors/200ok?social))

If anything looks off or you'd like to change something, just let us know!

## Registering Sponsor Tickets

Each person who is attending CascadiaJS 2022 on behalf of your company **MUST** register for the conference **THEMSELVES** using the special link that we emailed to you. This is necessary even if they are simply staffing a booth or providing support. Please do not have an admin run through the registration process on behalf of other people.

We require this because everyone at the event must to agree to our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). It also enables us to capture information about swag preferences, dietary restrictions, etc. 

*We thank you in advance for your help here!*

## Booking Lodging at Sunriver Resort

We have secured discounted rooms for all attendees (and sponsors) of CascadiaJS 2022 at Sunriver Resort. These rooms are located directly next to the buildings where the conference events will be taking place. It is definitely where you will want to be staying during the event.

Please note, there are only 245 total rooms at Sunriver Resort and we expect them to get booked out very quickly. So please make sure to book your lodging ASAP.

## Joining our Discord Community

Our Discord Community is an important place where we engage attendees leading up to and during the event. Please have folks join the community using the link below and have them send a DM to me (Carter Rabasa) so that I can assign them the "Partner" role. That will enable them to show-up on the sidebar as a partner of the conference.

## Social Media Guidance

Keep your eyes peeled for tweets from [@CascadiaJS](https://twitter.com/CascadiaJS). The official hashtags for this year's event are #CascadiaJS and #FamilyReunion.

This is optional, but if you'd like to provide us with something, it will be due by <span class="highlight warning">August 12</span>.

## Email Copy

If you are a Gold sponsor, your sponsorship includes adding some email copy to one of our emails to all attendees. 

Please send over some copy (no more than 2-3 paragraphs) so that we can get it prepped. No images or special formatting, just text and a clear call-to-action and link. This will also be due by <span class="highlight warning">August 12</span>.
