<!-- Sponsors are directed to this page after they fill-out the Onboarding Airtable form -->
Thank you SO MUCH for supporting CascadiaJS this year. Your support is the only reason we can make this magic happen.

## Your representation on our website

Now that we have your logo and marketing copy, we will update our website and let folks know you're joining us this year. You should see 3 things shortly:

- Your logo on our [main landing page](/)
- A personalized internal landing page ([example](/sponsors/200ok))
- A personalized social sharing image whenever this link is shared on Twitter/LinkedIn/Facebook/etc ([example](/sponsors/200ok?social))

If anything looks off or you'd like to change something, just let us know!

## Register using your free Sponsor tickets

Each person who is attending CascadiaJS 2022 on behalf of your company **MUST** register for the conference **THEMSELVES** using the special link that we emailed to you. This is necessary even if they are simply staffing a booth or providing support. Please do not have an admin run through the registration process on behalf of other people.

We require this because everyone at the event must to agree to our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). It also enables us to capture information about swag preferences, dietary restrictions, etc. 

*We thank you in advance for your help here!*

## Book your stay at Sunriver Resort

We have secured discounted rooms for all attendees (and sponsors) of CascadiaJS 2022 at Sunriver Resort. These rooms are located directly next to the buildings where the conference events will be taking place. It is definitely where you will want to be staying during the event.

Please note, there are only ~250 total rooms at Sunriver Resort and we expect them to get booked out very quickly. So please make sure to book your lodging ASAP.
