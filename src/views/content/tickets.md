## Group Sales and Registration

We ask people to register for their ticket themselves (and not on behalf of someone else) because during the registration process we ask folks to agree to our Code of Conduct and we collect important personal information, such as hoodie sizes and dietary restrictions.

For group/team purchases, please email us at tickets@cascadiajs.com. We can separate the payment process from the registration process. We can also provide group discounts for groups of 5 or more. Thank you!

## Indie Discount

If you are self-employed, work at a non-profit or work at a company with less than 10 employees, please use the discount code INDIE for 25% off your ticket.
