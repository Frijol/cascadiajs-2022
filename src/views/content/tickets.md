## Ticket Release Schedule

Tickets are released in batches. Each batch is limited in quantity, so please make sure you act fast to secure your ticket.

*Late Bird tickets will miss the option to personalize their conference hoodies (sizing, message on sleeve, etc)*

## Group Sales and Registration

We ask people to register for their ticket themselves (and not on behalf of someone else) because during the registration process we ask folks to agree to our Code of Conduct and we collect important personal information, such as hoodie sizes and dietary restrictions.

For group/team purchases, please email us at tickets@cascadiajs.com. We can separate the payment process from the registration process. We can also provide group discounts for groups of 5 or more. Thank you!

## Indie Discount

If you are self-employed, work at a non-profit or work at a company with less than 10 employees, please use the discount code INDIE for 25% off your ticket. 

## Virtual Tickets

For folks that can't join us in person, we have a Virtual Ticket option that will include:

<i class="fas fa-tv-retro"></i> Live Streamed Talk Track

<i class="fas fa-coffee"></i> Virtual Hallway Track

<i class="fas fa-handshake"></i> Virtual Expo Hall and Giveaways

## Apply for an Opportunity Scholarship

We have opened applications for Opportunity Scholarships! 

If you are a member of an under-represented minority in tech or have financial constraints that make purchasing a ticket difficult, please consider learning more and applying.
