## COVID

### What steps are being taken to ensure safety at this event?

The CascadiaJS organizers are currently monitoring the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) situation carefully and daily to ensure the safety of our attendees, speakers, and staff. With this mind, we plan on updating this information on a regular basis. Given what we know now, the following safety measures will be employed and enforced to the strictest possible extent:

- Anyone present on-site including attendees, sponsors, speakers, vendors, staff, and volunteers, are required to prove full vaccination, and provide a negative test result within 48 hours (for PCR) or 24 hours (for Antigen) of admission, and submit to a daily health screening with temperature check. Full vaccination is defined as 2 or more doses of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine, or 1 or more of the J&J vaccine.
- Hand sanitizer will be available at every sponsor booth and other locations.
- Lunch and dinner will be served outside.

Given these safety measures, we will likely make masking optional unless directed otherwise by government or health officials.

### I can't take the vaccine. Can I still come?

If you cannot take the vaccine due to a medical issue, an exemption can be made with proof of a doctor's note. You will still be required to submit proof of negative test result within 48 hours (for PCR) or 24 hours (for Antigen) of admission, and submit to daily temperature checks.

### What is involved in the Health Screening?

The health screening is a few questions that ask about your current health, known contact with Covid-positive indivduals, and documenting your temperature.

### In what instances will the conference be postponed, cancelled, or taken online?

The conference will move forward in-person unless shut down by local, state, or federal government or health officials.
