For those of you who do not live in Bend, OR, we have you covered! Please check out this travel guide for more information about how to get to Sunriver Resort and where to stay while you are here.

## Getting To Bend, OR

There are three ways we expect most folks from out of town to arrive in Bend, OR: car, shuttle bus or flight. The folks in Bend have published a handy [Getting to Bend](https://www.visitbend.com/plan-a-trip/getting-here/) guide that covers all of this.

### Shuttle Buses from Portland, OR

We are going to charter shuttle buses from Portland, OR to bring people to Sunriver on August 30 and to return them to Portland, OR on September 2. The buses will depart Portland, OR on August 30 around 2:30pm for an arrival into Sunriver of roughly 6pm. 

If you'd like a ride on this shuttle, hang tight, tickets will go on sale soon!

### Hacker Train from Seattle, WA

In conjunction with our plan to charter shuttle buses, we highly recommend folks traveling down from Seattle consider taking the train. It's a truly beautiful trip, the trains have Wi-Fi, and you can get up and move around during the journey.

We recommend the following trains:

- Aug 30 // 11 Coast Starlight train - departs Seattle, WA at 9:50am, arrives Portland, OR at 1:50pm
- Sep 02 // 14 Coast Starlight train - depart Portland, OR at 3:56pm, arrives Seattle, WA at 7:51pm

If you end up purchasing tickets on these trains PLEASE make sure to secure a ticket on the Portland-Bend shuttle bus. The shuttles will have limited capacity, so don't delay.

### Car Pools

We are also interested in helping people organize car pools departing from and return to Portland. If you are interested in catching a ride in a car pool or offering some seats in your car, please fill-out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrEUDtosdLy7IenQ) so we can start to figure this out.

### Flying in to RDM

If you plan on flying, the closest airport to Sunriver with is RDM.  Sunriver Resort is roughly 40 minutes from the airport, so we will organize a FREE shuttle bus to pick folks up from RDM on August 30th and bring them to Sunriver Resort and return folks to RDM following the Farewell Brunch on Sept 2.

NOTE: Alaska Airlines cancelled the only direct flight between PDX and RDM. There are plans to restore this service, but probably not in time for the conference. So if your plan was to fly from Portland, please consider the shuttle option or plan to drive.

### Traveling from Vancouver, BC

If you are travelling from Vancouver, BC we recommend the following options:

- Flights to/from Seattle ($200 USD) + Hacker Trains ($200 USD) + Shuttles ($50 USD)
- Flights to/from Portland ($250 USD) + Shuttles ($50 USD)
- Flights to/from RDM ($300 - $500 USD)

It mostly depends on your budget for travel and how fast you want to get here!
