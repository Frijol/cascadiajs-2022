The CascadiaJS 2022 conference is taking place August 30 - September 2, 2022 at Sunriver Resort, OR. Here is a rough schedule of events, please check back for updates and more fun stuff!

## Significant Others

We strongly encourage attendees to consider bringing their family and significant others. In order to make sure everyone feels as welcome as possible, we will arrange for Child Care (for kids 12 and under) and a Significant Others Track of fun activities during the day.

## Day Zero (August 30)

This is the day we strongly encourage everyone to travel to Sunriver. This will give you time to get here, check-in to your lodging and be fresh the next morning to kick-off the conference. For folks traveling from out of town, please review our [travel guide](/travel).

We are holding a Welcome Reception that will run from 3pm - 6pm and function as an opportunity for folks to register and hang out with fellow attendees. When you check-in to Sunriver Resort, you'll be directed to the Welcome Reception. We will serve drinks and light appetizers, but please make sure to make [plans for dinner](https://www.sunriverresort.com/dining-eat-drink/food-and-drinks-overview).
